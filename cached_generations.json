The parameters file contains the weights or parameters of the neural network, while the run file contains the code that runs the neural network using these parameters.",

The parameters file contains the weights or parameters of the neural network, while the run file contains the code that runs the neural network using these parameters. This is unlike many other language models that require access to a web interface or the internet.",
