{"questions": [{"question": "What is a large language model according to the speaker?", "choices": ["A single file", "Two files", "A web interface", "A GPU cluster"], "answer": "Two files", "sentence_in_transcription_before_asking": "So for example, working with the specific example of the LLAMA2 70b model, this is a large language model released by Meta.ai, and this is basically the LLAMA series of language models, the second iteration of it, and this is the 70 billion parameter model of this series."}, {"question": "What makes the LLAMA2 70b model popular?", "choices": ["It is the most powerful closed weights model", "It is the most powerful open weights model", "It is the fastest model", "It is the most expensive model"], "answer": "It is the most powerful open weights model", "sentence_in_transcription_before_asking": "Now many people like this model specifically because it is probably today the most powerful open weights model."}, {"question": "What is required to run the LLAMA2 70b model?", "choices": ["Parameters file and a run file", "A web interface", "A GPU cluster", "An internet connection"], "answer": "Parameters file and a run file", "sentence_in_transcription_before_asking": "So the parameters are basically the weights or the parameters of this neural network that is the language model. We'll go into that in a bit."}, {"question": "What does the run file do in the context of the LLAMA2 70b model?", "choices": ["It stores the parameters of the neural network", "It runs the neural network", "It collects text from the internet", "It performs lossy compression"], "answer": "It runs the neural network", "sentence_in_transcription_before_asking": "You also need something that runs that neural network, and this piece of code is implemented in our run file."}, {"question": "What is the main task of the neural network in the LLAMA2 70b model?", "choices": ["Predict the next word in a sequence", "Generate a poem", "Translate languages", "Summarize text"], "answer": "Predict the next word in a sequence", "sentence_in_transcription_before_asking": "So you can feed in a sequence of words, for example, catsat on a. This feeds into a neural net and these parameters are dispersed throughout this neural network."}]}
